void QVulkanWindowRenderer::logicalDeviceLost()
This virtual function is called when the logical device (VkDevice) is lost, meaning some operation failed with VK_ERROR_DEVICE_LOST.

The default implementation is empty.

There is typically no need to perform anything special in this function. QVulkanWindow will automatically release all resources (invoking releaseSwapChainResources() and releaseResources() as necessary) and will attempt to reinitialize, acquiring a new device. When the physical device was also lost, this reinitialization attempt may then result in physicalDeviceLost().

See also physicalDeviceLost().
